Complete details about the dataset and data dictionary can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).
## Summary of Findings

After an in-depth analysis, the data revealed that the majority of the borrowers are employed as they dominate more than half of the loan records. As the Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate increases, the Leander Yield tends to increase, on the other hand, a negative correlation was observed between Borrower's Annual Percentage Ratand and Proster Score. The major reason for borrowing appears to be debt consolidation.


## Key Insights
Below are some of the key insights.
* Loans with higher Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate and Lender Yield tend to have a lower Prosper Score
* A strong positive correlation was observed between Borrower's APR and the Lender's Yield
* As the Borrower's APR increases, the Prosper Score tends to decrease, which translates to a negative correlation
* The data revealed that the major reason for taking a loan is debt consolidation 
* Borrowers that are employed with high monthly income appear to take high loans
* Borrower's APR has an almost normal distribution, with an exceptional count when it was 0.35797% and 0.35643%.
